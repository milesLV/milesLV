## Miles Libbey (that's me!)

### Hi!
I'm a recent Data Science graduate from Macalester College focused on starting my career in data! 

I'm currently working on a few projects across different areas:

1. **R + GraphQL Nonprofit Mapping Project**  
   An expansion of my previous project that uses **R** and **GraphQL** to map the reach of U.S. nonprofit organizations in rural areas.  
   It visualizes which causes are available where, how well-funded they are, and integrates data from [CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/).

2. **Multi-Agentic AI Research & Summarization Tools (Python + [n8n](https://n8n.io/))**  
   - One project creates a multi-agent AI that can research any topic, produce a robust summary covering all perspectives and potential biases, and properly cite its sources.  
   - Another project focuses on text processing: given a `.pdf` (or any text file), the AI outputs a clean, reformatted version (like `.md` or `.txt`), along with a concise summary.

3. **Java Naval Simulator (for fun!)**  
   A purely Java-based naval simulation project that I’m using to learn:
   - How to leverage AI tools like GitHub Copilot  
   - How to orchestrate multiple files and functions efficiently  
   - Core Java programming concepts

To paraphrase Socrates: *"I know one thing — that I know nothing."*  
Currently , I’m focused on:

- **SQL:** Practicing on LeetCode, using [dbfiddle](https://dbfiddle.uk/), YouTube, and webinars.
- **AI:** Learning through YouTube and attending a variety of AI-related events.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) & Multi-Agentic RL (MARL)** I have been reading [Sutton and Barto, 2018](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) and [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FHXGVWkzjKsnNxzVN-29dx5vdkffAx5Vji5nWrDvg1Y/edit?slide=id.g239e0ea1d8b_0_63#slide=id.g239e0ea1d8b_0_63) with the [Silicon Valley GenAI MeetUp Group!](https://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-generative-ai/)
- **Data Visualization:** Reading all of Edward Tufte’s books, completing his online course, and participating in a few [Tidy Tuesdays](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

### Quick Fun Facts About Me
* I have 10 Snoopy shirts (in-counting)
* I'm the fifth Miles Libbey (I have a V at the end of my name)
* I memorized the periodic table 5 years ago and can still tell you either the atomic number given an element or the element given an atomic number (with a margin of $\pm 2$)
